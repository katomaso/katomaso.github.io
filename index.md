# DOH! Don't Hurt My Brain

Voil√† a list of eyes-bleeders which I think is important to know when you
want to become a serious programmer.

Short and to the point.

-  [Open vs. Closed IF forms (May 2017)](doh/open-closed-if-form)
-  [Distinguish internal and external functions (May 2017)](doh/external-functions)
-  [Class constructors (June 2017)](doh/constructors)


# Papers

It is better to read than to write - especially when I have unsifficient

   A 101 paper of modular decomposition (quite old indeed)
